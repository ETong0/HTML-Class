		<h3>Poop</h3>
		<h4>What happens to a person when they eat poop? </h4>
		<p>According to the Illinois Poison Center, eating poop is “minimally toxic.” However, poop naturally contains the bacteria commonly found in the intestines. While these bacteria don’t harm you when they’re in your intestines, they’re not meant to be ingested in your mouth.</p>
		<p> Examples of bacteria commonly present in poop include: Campylobacter E. coli Salmonella Shigella <p/>
		<p>These bacteria can cause you to experience symptoms such as: nausea diarrhea vomiting fever </p>
		<p>Parasites and viruses like hepatitis A and hepatitis E are also transmitted via poop. You can become ill by coming in contact with these through other measures, such as kissing an unwashed hand. Therefore, if you eat a larger amount of poop directly, you’re at greater risk for adverse symptoms.</p>
		<p> Sometimes you may accidentally ingest poop, such as eating contaminated foods. This will cause symptoms that are similar to those of food poisoning. </p>
		<p>Time and drinking plenty of fluids can usually help reduce most symptoms associated with accidental poop ingestion.</p>
		
		<h4>Children ingesting poop</h4>
		<p>Children can sometimes eat their own feces or that of a pet, such as a dog, cat, or bird. <p/>
		<p>If your child has eaten poop, it’s not usually cause for concern. However, there are still some steps parents or caregivers should take: Give the child water. Wash their face and hands. Observe them for symptoms that are usually similar to food poisoning. </p>
		<p>Symptoms similar to food poisoning include: diarrhea low-grade fever nausea vomiting</p>
		<p> If you’re concerned about your child’s symptoms, call your local poison control center at 1-800-222-1222. </p>
		<p>If symptoms persist or even begin a few weeks later, call your child’s pediatrician. They may recommend taking a stool sample to identify the presence of organisms such as parasites or bacteria.</p>
		<p> This is especially true if a child ate animal feces. Animal feces may have other parasites present, such as roundworms.</p>
